8 Gosmp Exsns,

The spiral muscles round the narrow tube, which can easely be contracted
serve evidently to keep the spermatozoa in the seminal vesicle and
prevent them from escaping in undue time. From the form and free
suspension of the inner duct, it may easely le seen that its free exterior
extremity can be considerably extended clear down to the penis proper
at the moment of copulation.

The end of the penis is generally straight, slightly swelled‚ but is
also found helixlike (fig. 13. p.).

The total absence of efferent funnels is a characteristic of great
value, not met with anywhere else in this class of worms, and which
places Eclipidrilas· in a decidedly isolated position. The general structur
and arrangement of the generative organs as well as the simplicity of
the ventral vessel etc. shows this worm to be a true limicolide oligoch-
aete, and nearest allied to the families ot' Tuszfividoe and vacmbrieuliclce.

The segflnental organs are with certainty present in all the segments
posterior to the 9¹¹¹ setigerous segment, but in the anterior segments I
have not yet discovered them. These organs are extremely delicate and
consist of a long slender and simple tube⁷ whose exterior porus is found
¹just in front of the ventral spines and in a straight line drawn between
the spines7 the efferent duct, the oviduct. and semina] receptacle of the
same side (fig. 4). The interior end of each segmenta] organ is as usual
projected into or through the (lissipiment of each anterior segment. The
neck of the organ is here considerably swelled, bottle like7 and gland-
ulous, and the orifice itself is surrounded by large and small globular
and pellucid inflatioris. (Fig 9).

The spineis are absent in the cephalic lohe and buccal segment,
but in all the other segmentis⁷ we find 8 spines in 4 pairs, as in Lum-
brz'cul2'da‘. The spines are slightly S shaped and their free ends entire.

Habitat. Eclz'piaelrz'lus· friyiclns is as yet only found in the high
,Sierm Nevada of (5⁷‹zlzjf'0rma at an altitude of 10,000 feet or more. It
lives here in the bottom mud or more frequently yet among moss att-
ached to rocks over which the cold or even icy water is constantly
flowing at least during the warni season. The head end of the worm is
generally burrowed in the mud or moss, and the tail freely vibrating in
the water.
