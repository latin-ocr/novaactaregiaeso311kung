2 GUSTAF Ε1811Ν,

ECLIPIDRILIDAE. Fam. nov.

Vascuuar system consists of two primary longitndinal vessels: one
ventral vessel not puls-ating, and one dorsal vessel pnlsating.

Generative system. The efferent (laets are not connected with the
testes, and their free interior extremities are not furnished with any
efferent 1111111618, but here considerably elongated and enclosing a sack-
11116 Vesicula seminalis or male seininal receptacle. The atrium of the
efferent duct is furnished with 3 mimae osteum-«ss for the entering of the
spermatozoa. The oviducts are two, not directly connected with the
efferent duct, nor invaginated by the same.

The spines are entire, occur 111 pairs of 2, of which 4 in every
segment, as in the faniilies 01 Tubificidw and chmbrieulidm.

ECLIPIDRILUS nov, gen.

The ‹lorsac ves-sel is weakly pulsating not furnished with any hearts
and not branching.

The ventral ve.<·.s›el is not pulsating but branching in the first seti-
gerous segment of the body.

The latetal 01 eemmclaty vessels ire pwntlyg astric, partly peri-
eastris), but both kinds are 1101 found originatino in the same segments.
The dorsal and ventral vessels are not connected by secondary vessels
in 1116 30 odd last seglnents of the body.

The two effetent (laets are found in the 9t¹¹ setigerous segment,
and extends backwards 10 the 14ωι segment or so. An exterior penis
present.

The two ovidzccts in the 9²¹³ segment and opening between the 9²¹³
and 10⁰¹ setigerous seglnents.

The ovaries in 3 pairs, one each in the 8““, 9111 A} 10⁸¹ setigerous
segments.

The testes are amorphous⁷ one paire in the 10⁸¹ to l3t¹³ setigerous
seglnents.
