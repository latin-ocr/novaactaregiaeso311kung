ECLIPIDR1L1DAE AND THEIR ANATOMY. 3

ECLIPIDRILUS FRIGIDUS n. sp.

Vascular system. The dorsal and ventral l‹:›ngitudinal vessels are
of nearly the same size, the former only is pulsating. The ventral vessel
is forked in the first setigerous segment of the body, the dorsa] vessel
is entire, connecting with the two forks of the ventral vessel in the ee-
phalic lobe (Pl. I. fig. 2. D. V. ἃ vv)

The second-ary or lateral vessels are of two kinds viZ.:

a. perigyastrie, situated in the perigastric cavity of the body, and
b. 9ηςτνὶσ, situated on or close to the alimentary canal.
The periqastric vessels· are of two kinds, viz:
1. Connecting perigastric vessels, and
2. free perigastric vessels.

The connecting! perz'qastric vessels are found in the anterior seg-
ments of the body⁷ connecting the two principal longitudine] vessels.
One pair is found in the bucealic-seginent and one pair each in the nine
first setigerous segments (Pl. 1. fig. 2. pv). The two last connecting]
periyastrie vessels, originating respectively in the 8¹¹³ ὣ 9⁰² setigerous seg-
ments, are considerably longer than the rest and furnish blood both to
the generative and copulative organs. They are also not confined to
their respective segments but extend considerably backvvards, sometimes
as far as to the 10²¹· or 14⁰· seglnent. The anterior pair is the shortest‚
and extends only to the 100¹ seginent, while the pair originating in the 9²¹¹
segment extends as far back as the 14⁰¹ segment or as far as the sexual
organs reach. In the 100¹ and following posterior segments, no connecting
perigastric vessels are found. None of these connecting perigastric vessels
are dilated to hearts, but all are slightly pulsating, the anterior ones
more so than the posterior ones (fig. 2).

The free periqastric vessels are dorsal and found in the 30 odd
posterior segments, two pair in every segment‚e1nitted from the pulsat-
ing dorsal vessel, and also themselves slightly pulsating. As to the form,
they are short, thick, and all more or less imperfectly forked or branohed.
Their inner end is free, and does not connect with the ventral vessel,
(Pl. I. fig. 3. pv.).

Of the qastv‘ic vessels one pair is found in every segment, which
does not contain any perigastric vessels: The gastrie vessels run along
side the alimentary canal and connect the ventral and dorsallongitudinal
