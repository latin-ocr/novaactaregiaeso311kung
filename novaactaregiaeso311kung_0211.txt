ECLIPIDRILIDAE AND THEIR ANATOMY. 5

nervetrunc.¹ are as in Telmatodrilas connected by numerous anastomosing
commissures of the same width, or wider even than the cords themselves.
(Pl. ΙΙ. fig. 8). The cephalic plexus forms a cephalic ganglion in size and
form very similar to that of Rlaeymwlaelmix ¹) and Ocnerodrihcff). The em-
argination of its frontal margine is rather slight, but the posterior lobes
are plain and projected. The nuclei and nucleoli of the cephalie ganglion
are large and distinct and rather closely pneked. No lateral or second-
ary nerves are projected either from the ventral trunc or from 1110 00-
phalic ganglion.

Generative system. The sexual organs :ire of two kinds viz: Ge-
neratz've and Rea-optivo.

The Generatim organs are either
male, or testes, or
female, or omnies.

The Receptive organs are also
male, or efferent (laets, or
female, or ‹widuc-ts· and

receptaclesa

The testes consist of two large sacklike and amorphous bodies,
situated in the segments 9⁶¹¹ to 13⁰¹ 11101., 0110 on each side of the body,
and entirely covering the other sexual organs in the same segments.
(Pl. Ι. fig. 1. t).

Similar testes are found both in Tubffleiclae and Lmnbrz'culisloe. ln
the former family in Spirosperma χει-0113) 111 the latter in Eltynclzelmiff)
and Ph1·eczt0tlzrioe⁵).

The testes commin numerous cysts of spermatozoa, but no free
ones. Each such cyst consist of a globular body, attached 10, or tap-
ering to a round wedge-shaped tail. This body 18 covered with smaller
globules full of a granulated, oily matter, among which eellnuclei res-
embling bodies are intermixed. The tail of this spermatozoa-cyst is
sometimes straight, sometimes 110111, and is always covered by globules,
which are either partly separate, or which run together forming beauti-
sully elevated ridges. (Pl. I. fig. 7.). These ridges are either transve1·sal‚
spiral, or longitudinal, and separated by fields of equa] size and regular
