ECLIPIDRILIDAE AND THEIR ANATOMY. 7

The interior extremity of the ducts is free7 suspended in the
perigastric cavity of the body, but the exterior extreniity 16, as usual⁷
attached to the body wall, and a part of it projects beyond the sanic
forming a retractile exterior penis proper (fig. 13. p.). The long-est
of the two bags, which constitute the efferent duct, is the one directly
connected with the body wall, and is nearer its interior end furnished
with 3 very minute circular openings, through which the spermatozsm
evidently enter.

Inside and freely suspended within this exterior duct we find
another interior one7 -of very much the sanie forn] :ind size as the former,
only it is soinewhat 61101161, its exterior extremity being free and not
attached to the body wall, nor being able to be projected through the
same. This extremity is furnished with a large circular opening. The
1111161 extremity of this interior duct ends blindly⁷ and is always full of
spermotozoa and serve accordingly as a true serninal vesicle, in which the
sperniatozoa are stored, before they are ejected through the sexual porus.

The exterior duct consiste of at least three different layers, one
exterior epithelial layer‚ one middle laycr⁷ much thicker than the others,
consisting of heavy longitudinal 1111166166, and one interior membranous
layer, which at the exterior extremit-y is separated fron] the two former
ones and form by itself a pellucid inembranous penis, at times found
projected through the sexual porus. The two exterior 01166 of these
layers connect directly with the body wall of which they seem to be a 111616
continuation. This structure of the exterior duct is the same throughout
the organ, except at. the narrow 111106, which connects the two sacks
<the seininal vescile and the atrium) which former is surrounded by
numerous spiral 1111166166, very similar to those found in Canzsttodrilas· ¹)
(fig. 13 ὦ 14 spr.).

If we therefore consider 1116 6011166 a sperniatozoon can take, after
having escaped from the 166166, we find that the efferent duct is most
admirably adopted to the purpose of transmitting and storing spermatozoa.
A spermatozoon after having entered the efferent duct, through one of
the three small circular openings (or. fig. 13 A} 14) passes down the
exterior duct towards the sexual porus, but is on its way intercepted by
the exterior opening of the inner duct (fig. 13 01. 111.), and attracted by
the ciliated epithelium of its inner surface, ascends through the exterior
part of the duct (fig. 13 in> up through the narrow tube and is finally
lodged in the seminal 11661616, and is here stored 11111111 of future use.
