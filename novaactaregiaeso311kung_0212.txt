form. The regularity and beauty of this structure can only be compared
with that of skeletons of certain Diatonies. These spermatozoa-cysts are
not unlike the spermatophores of thbzfleiclcc.

The ovaries occur in 3 pairs and are of very diminutive size.
(Pl. I. fig. 1.; Pl. ΙΙ. fig. 11). The anterior pair is found in the 3²¹¹ seg-
nient, attached to the dissipiinent between this and the 4⁸¹ segment.
The second pair is similarly found in the 9t¹¹ segment, attached to the
dissipiment between the same and the 8 seginent. The last or 3⁸¹ pair
is found in the 10³¹ segment, attached to the dissipement between the
same and the ΩΨ setigerous segment.

The form of the ovary is variable, still the ovaries of the same
pair is mostly of the same shape, sometimes resembling a bagpipe,
sometimes again more like a complicated S. The niatured ova are always
situated at the free margine of the ovary7 but even they are of such
diminutive size7 that they even when fully developped are only 2 or 3
times larger than the smallest ovula in the ovary.

As oviducts (Pl. I. fig. 6 <iv 1) Ι consider two very minute and
extremely delicate organs, of a shape somewhat similar to the oviducts
of the genera of Lambriffllhloe, and which are situated in the 9t¹¹ segment.
The exterior porus of the oviduct is found between the segments 9 Sc 10,
in a line between the spines and the porus of the efferent duct (Pl. I. fig. 4.
ovd). The oviduct is funnel-shaped with a proportionately large globular
and bladderlike interior orifice. This latter is not furnished with vibrating
ciliae, which are wholly restricted to the interior tube of the organ.

The receptacle (Pl. I. fig. 1 &v Pl. Il. f. 12> consist of two large
chitinous bodies, situated in the 8⁰¹ setigerous segnient, and whose ext-
ernal porus opens a little behind the spines of that seg-ment. Each re-
ceptacle consists of two distinct parts7 the interior of which is inflated
and egglike, — the receptacle proper — and one more narrow tubelike
part7 connecting the former with the exterior porus of the organ.

The ‘receptae-le shows a great similarity with the same organs of
chszficz‘da* and Lumbrivulidw. Its interior cavity is nearly always full of
free sperinatozoa with long and sharply defined tails.

The efferent ‹laets› are ἱ), of enorlnous size, occupying the segments
9 to 14. The exterior porus of the duct is situated in the 9ῑΙι segment
just behind the ventral spines. Each efferent duct consists of two large,
rather cylindrieal, sacklike ducts of nearly equal size, which at the
extremities are connected by a narroxv, short tube, of the same general
structure as the rest of the organ⁷ except being surrounded by spiral
niuscles (Pl. II. fig. 13 ὁέ 14. spr).
