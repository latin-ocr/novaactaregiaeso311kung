vessels with each other. Between these gastris vessels we find a perfect
net of tertiary rectilinear vessels, running in and on the layers of the
alimentary canal. (Pl. I. fig. 2. g. v, p. & g. V. 8.).

From the head backwards we therefore meet with the following
secondary vessels: In the first segments inclusive the 9⁹¹ only conuect—
ing perigastric vessels, one pair in every segment. From the 10th segment
and backwards gastric vessels between which a perfect net of rectilinear
secondary gastric vessels. In the 30 odd last segments we find only
free perigastric vessels, 2 pairs in every segment, none of which is
connected with the ventral vessel.

Thus the vascular system of Eclipidrilax, however characteristic,
does greatly resemble the same system in Τιιὸζῖὶυὶιῖαε and Lumbrz‘culidce.
The most characterizing feature is the presence of only one pair of
secondary vessels in every segment except the 30 last ones. In most
genera of the above families we generally find both gastric and periga-
gastric vessels in the same segment. In Eclipiclribzcs, this is never the case.

An other prominent feature is the unusual length of the peri-
gastric vessels in the 8²¹¹‹S‘z9th segments. A somewhat similar elongation
of the perigastric vessels is also found in Telmatoclrz‘lus1> in the family
of Tzcbfflcz'dae. In this genus however the perigastric vessels are confined
to their proper segments, performing however the same duty⁷ viz: the
furnishing of blood to the sexual organs.

The forking or imperfect feathering of the posterior perigastric
vessels, is also found in Plu'eatotlwioeVejcl.²). But in this worm, as in all
other genera of Tabljsicidae and Lmnbricucviclae, the ventral and dorsal
vessels are always connected by second-ary vessels.

The blood is redish yellow and sufficiently bright to appear through
the body wall. Even for the unarmed eye the ventral vessel appears
as a red continual streak, from which sometimes even the secondary
vessels are seen branching.

The alimenta& canat is extremely simple. 11 consists merely of
a simple duct, similar to that of Tzcbzsssiscidoe. In the 5 first setigerous
segments the duct is pellucichbut in the following segments it is covered
with dark opaque glands, similar to those so often found in near related
families,

The nervon-s· system of Eclz'pidrilas presents no very distinct char-
acteristics The two ventral nerve cords, which together form the ventral
