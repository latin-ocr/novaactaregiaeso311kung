Two years ago, or 1878, while travelling among the snowy peaks of
California's Sierra Nevada, my attention was attracted to a smale lim-
icolide Oligoehaete, which I at first sight easely recognized as new and
interesting. I was at the time not armed with any mieroscope or even
stronger lens, and could therefore not even preliminary study its vascular
system, and speoimens which I attempted to preserve alive until my
arrival to the plains7 died unfortunately already on the second day after
captivity.

The worm was found in a small rapidly flowing spring, which for
9 months of the year must certainly remain ieebound and whose waters
for the three remaining months never could have attained a temperature
of much over 40⁰ Fahr.

The few specimens which I preserved in aleohol proved upon
examination to belong to a worm, whose many new and remarkable
features pla-ced it in an entirely isolated systematis: position among the
Oligoehaeta. To investigate the vaseular system of the same I had no
other 0110100 than to return the following year to the high Sierra-Crests
and⁷ better provided with instruments, work 0111 1110 circulatory part of
the anatomy on the spot. This successfully done the rest of the ana-
tomy was studied from dissections of alcoholie specimens.

In the following I will first shortly charaeterize the Family and
genus and afterwards more minutely present. the anatomieal character-
istios and compare them with those of other nearly related families.
